/**
 * Frame table and body geometry of the HD characters.
 *
 * Frames are 32×56 texels (2× density) and shown at 16×28 world px, anchored at the feet. The
 * top HEADROOM rows (WD2) are room for tall people and tall hats: painters work in body rows,
 * where row 0 is the first row under the headroom (paintSheet offsets them), so a body row is
 * where it was in the old 32×48 frame. Body rows, standing:
 *   head 6-23 (hair may rise to ~2, tall hats into the headroom, down to row -8), torso 24-35,
 *   waistband 31, legs split at 38, feet on row 43, outline rows 44-45 (world row 22).
 * Seated frames move head + torso 6 texels down (3 world px, as before).
