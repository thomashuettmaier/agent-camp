 * Paper-doll characters. One HD painter (art/avatar/*) draws everybody from a CharacterLook:

 *
 * Frames are 32×56 texels at 2× density and shown at 16×28 world px (texture resolution 2),
 * anchored at the feet: the body is the bottom 16×24 as before, the 4 world px on top are
 * headroom for tall people and tall hats (WD2), so layout, seats, hit-testing and animations
 * are unchanged. One sheet (36 frames) per RenderLook; sheets are cached so siblings and
 * re-joins reuse them.
